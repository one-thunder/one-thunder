### Heyo! ðŸ’¬

My name is Alex, a mere JS/Node developer from Moldova ready for any interesting challenge.  
Boredom kills me, so if you want me dead, give me some UI related things. But srsly, I can do anything provided there is enough coin :moneybag:  

### Professional work :city_sunrise:

I started working as a freelancer on various sites (mostly Russian), after that my first company was Endava where I got proficient in all sorts of things mostly on Angular, and Node.js. After 3 years there I moved to my carrier to next company which specialized in React and I am working here currently.

### Personal work âš¡

Call me crazy but I REALLY LOVE C++, especially modern cxx and it's implications in game development.  
At the moment, I am still learning it alongside with Unreal Engine.  

Also I am a huge fan of Lineage2, so at this point I am creating a set of tools for decrypting/decoding/extracting all data from the game,  
and will try to create a replica in Unreal Engine 4 just for the sake of lulz.  

Some of this work you can see below :point_down:
